# Stopword and Whiteword Help File

Voyants uses a Stopword list in most tools to control what words you see. By default it is set to Auto-detect which detects the language you are using and, if we have a stopword list in that language, uses it. To choose or edit the list used do the following:

1. Select the **Options panel** in the tool you want to affect. (You can set them globally too!)
2. Click on the menu where it says "Auto-detect". That will give you choices if you want to force Voyant to use a language. Alternatively you can enter the ID of an edited stopword list right in the field instead of "Auto-detect".
3. If you want to Edit the list then click the **Edit** button next to the field/menu. That will open this **Edit Stoplist** panel:

4. To edit the list, just delete words or type them in. Then press **Save**.
5. Note that you will now see a custom ID for the Stopword list in the Options panel. If you want to reuse this edited list in another Voyant session you should click on the ID and copy it so you can save it somewhere.
