# Stopword and Whiteword Help File

Voyants uses a Stopword list in most tools to control what words you see. By default it is set to Auto-detect which detects the language you are using and, if we have a stopword list in that language, uses it. To choose or edit the list used do the following:

![Options Panel](/terms.options.jpg | width=200)

1. Select the Options panel in the tool you want to affect. (You can set them globally too!)
2. Click on the menu where it says Auto-detect. That will give you choices if you want to force Voyant to use a language. Alternatively you can enter the ID of an edited stopword list right in the field.
3. If you want to Edit the list then click the **Edit** button next to the field/menu.
