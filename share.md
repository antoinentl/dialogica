# Sharing Results:Exporting and Embedding: Teaching Guide

**Note**: This page is a **teaching guide** with advice for using [Walkthrough 3: Sharing Results](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1a2VRBO_vULjZ7t5t2DA8wMN0hQNC18zw) (Downloadable MS Word file). 

**Also**: Our general teaching philosophy is available in the [Introduction](/intro.md). Feel free to skip this Teaching Guide and just read and adapt the Walkthrough.

## About Walkthrough 3

The third walkthrough focuses on how to embed interactive Voyant panels into web pages of different sorts. This allows learners to then create essays or other sustained contributions and publish them for peers and the instructor to 

## Objectives

The objectives of Walkthrough 3 are to show learners how to:

- embed interactive Voyant panels in a web page
  - do this in an HTML page
  - do this in WordPress
  - do this in Google Sites
- Show learners how to edit a URL for Voyant to change the parameters
- Encourage learners to think about 

## Discussion

This walkthrough allows instructors to get students to the point where they can write essays or similar assignments with text analysis embedded in the online essays. To do that we show a number of different ways to get 

We call these interpretative and interactive panels "hermeneutica" or hermeneutical things. You can read our thinking and see examples in our book [Hermeneutica](http://hermeneuti.ca). 

This walkthrough should be edited to match the technology suite that you want students to use. For example, if you have taught students to write HTML from scratch then you should use that section. If your students all get WordPress access, then use that.

### Exercises

Just as you should edit the walkthrough to include only the technology you want students to use, likewise you should edit the exercises so that only the one you want is there. You may want to supplement the exercise you choose with information about the environment you want students to try, be it HTML pages, WordPress or Google Docs. 

The last two exercises are more advanced. Exercise 3 assumes knowledge of HTML and how to lay out a page. Exercise 4 introduces Spyral, a notebook programming environment built on Voyant.
