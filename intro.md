# Introduction to Dialogica

Welcome to **Dialogica: Thinking-Through Voyant** (DTTV). This is a cross between a dialogue on computer-assisted text analysis and a hands-on guide to using Voyant <http://voyant-tools.org>. The idea is that reflection on questions and hands-on experimentation complement each other. We think they are the best way to learn how to use computer-assisted text analysis to interpret electronic texts. Playing with Voyant can be an occasion for reflecting back on both tools and questions about text analysis. 

> What are dialogica?

Dialogica are dialogical things. This web site grew out of conversations we had and it brings together learning materials designed around questions and conversations with others, software and texts. Dialogi.ca the web site has two types of things:

- We have pages like this one that are "meta" and talk about how to teach with the materials here, and
- We link to the walkthroughs.

> What are the Walkthroughs?

The Walkthroughs are self study materials that you can use to learn on your own or adapt for students. They are Microsoft Word files so you can edit them as needed and we share them under a  [Creative Commons By Attribution license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) so you can adapt as needed.

> What is Voyant?

Voyant is the collection of tools that evolved out of our experiments and these walkthroughs will show you how use Voyant for you own. Hermeneutica theorized computer-assisted text interpretation and included interludes where we showed the thinking-through of some experiments (see <http://hermeneuti.ca> for dynamic examples). DTTV takes the approach of weaving questions about electronic texts and text analysis together with hands-on walks that start with Voyant and then go beyond.

> Why all this dialogical discourse?

In the spirit of encouraging you to think through the issue, this is a conversational set of walkthroughs. We alternate questions that encourage you to think about with activities to try and then discussions with more questions. We encourage students to pause and think through the questions before proceeding. Think of these walkthroughs as dialogue thingies with which to start conversations not end them. 

> Can I just play with the tools?

Of course! We hope you do get distracted by the tools. That's a great way to learn. Stop and play with a tool or feature. Experiment on your own. We want you get to the point where you can use Voyant to talk about and through texts.

# About Dialogica: Thinking-Through Voyant

We thank all those who have worked with us on Voyant. The dialogical nature of this book comes from our conversations with each other and with others when teaching text analysis in workshops, classes and online. When we teach in the digital humanities we like to ask questions first, then play with dialogical things as a way of exploring, and leave lecturing for an end.
