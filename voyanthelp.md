# Voyant Help Files

Welcome to the Voyant Help Files. These are short pages designed to show you how to do things in Voyant. We will be developing them as people ask us questions. Feel free to send us tricks you have learned or ask us questions.

### Editing Stopword and Whiteword Lists
In Voyant tools like Cirrus, Terms, and Links you can edit the Stopword list that is used to exclude words. There is also a Whiteword feature if you want to limit the words used. Learn more with our [Stopword and Whiteword Help File](/stopword.md).
